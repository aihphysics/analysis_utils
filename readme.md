# Analysis Utils

## Description
Source code and included CMakeLists.txt construct a library for import in other c++ projects in cmake. With AthAnalysis releases this should compile as is, on other machines, adding -std=c++17 should correct any compilation issues. Library contains files for faster usage of ROOT in the ATLAS style for analysis. Work is underway. Config files for the bound and fit manager are stored in share

## TODO:

* Add TF1 styling and processing.
* Add style reader and stylising objects.
